# Forecasting Kickstarter Crowdfunding Success

With the rising popularity for crowdfunding as a source for creative projects, we seek to construct a machine-learning model to forecast the probability of crowdfunding success on [Kickstarter Platform.](https://www.kickstarter.com/) We implemented model selection using GridsearchCV from sklearn package with the best being being Random-Forest.   Our final model succeeded in correctly categorizing the failure and success of a Kickstart funding at 65% on average.   

This project is undertaken as a requirement for completion of BAIT509 Business Applications of Machine Learning Course for the Master of Business Analytics Program at the UBC.


### Dataset

We utilized the following data set to construct our model.  The data set is publically availabe on Kaggle.  We utilized the 2018 data set (ks-projects-201801.csv), which is composed of all historical project until end 2017.
